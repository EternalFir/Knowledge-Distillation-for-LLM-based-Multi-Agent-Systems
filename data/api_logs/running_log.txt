evaluation: ["No","The sub-tasks miss acquiring a container for mixing. Add steps to find/use a container (e.g., cup, bowl) after obtaining salt and water, as mixing requires a vessel. Also confirm water source accessibility (e.g., tap needs activation)."]
evaluation: ["No","Sub-tasks still miss acquiring salt/container (need 'pick up' actions). Add steps: after step3 'Pick up salt', after step5 'Take container'. Also clarify how to collect water (use 'pour' or 'activate tap' action) and mix (use 'mix' action explicitly)."]
evaluation: ["No","Step 10 assumes a stirrer exists (not observed in kitchen). Replace with explicit 'mix' action. Also ensure 'pick up container' is explicitly stated (step7 'take' â‰  inventory acquisition). Add step after 6: 'Pick up container'. Final mix should use action 'mix container'."]
evaluation: ["Yes","Good job! All critical steps are now explicitly covered: acquiring salt, container, activating tap, pouring water, mixing via 'mix' action (step 11 aligns with available actions). No further gaps observed."]
