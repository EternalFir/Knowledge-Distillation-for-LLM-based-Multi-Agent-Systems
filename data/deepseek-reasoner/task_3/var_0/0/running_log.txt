evaluation: ["No","The planner should first verify if the picture contains usable pigments and ensure tools for extraction (e.g., scraper, solvent) are available. Assuming the picture has blue/yellow pigments without confirmation and lacking tools makes the plan risky. Add steps to inspect the picture's contents and acquire tools if needed."]
evaluation: ["Yes","Improved plan addresses prior gaps by verifying pigments/tools and adding improvisation steps. However, check if 'air-drying' is relevant for pigment extraction (may need chemical solvent alternatives). Ensure 'use OBJ on OBJ' action can handle improvised tools like frame parts. Good adjustments overall."]
