evaluation: ["No","The cupboard may not contain water or a heat source; suggest checking inventory for existing water or heat tools. Using paint's water content is uncertain. Ensure feasible heat exposure method exists."]
evaluation: ["No","Ensure the room has sunlight via a window (not mentioned in observation) or confirm a heat tool exists in the cupboard. 'Warm area' is vague; suggest specifying a concrete method (e.g., using a found lamp). Steps are logical but rely on unconfirmed environmental factors."]
evaluation: ["Yes","Steps now account for heat tool availability and handle contingencies. Assumes paint is water-based (verify if possible via 'look at blue paint'). Logical flow with clear termination points if resources are missing. Good adjustments."]
