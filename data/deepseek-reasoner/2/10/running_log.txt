evaluation: ["No", "The cupboard's contents are unknown; the plan assumes nuts are present. Suggest checking the cupboard first and, if no nuts, explore using available paints or other substances for a chemical mixture instead."]
evaluation: ["Yes", "Improved contingency planning! Accounts for absence of nuts and creatively uses available paints while maintaining chemistry focus. Good adaptive structure with branching paths."]
