env_response:  No known action matches that input.
reward:  0
response:  **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Confirm Bowl Placement:** Ensure the bowl with sodium acetate solution is correctly positioned at the fire pit.  
   - Previous action: `move bowl to fire pit` ✅ (successful).  

2. **Initiate Heating:** Use the active fire pit to apply heat to the bowl.  
   - Attempted `use fire pit on bowl` ❌ (failed).  
   - Alternative: Since the fire is already lit, heating occurs passively.  

3. **Wait for Evaporation:** Allow time for water to evaporate.  
   - Use the `wait` action (valid in the action list).  

4. **Verify Crystallization:** Check the bowl contents post-heating.  
   - Action: `look in bowl` to confirm sodium acetate crystals formed.  

**Final Action:**  
`wait`
