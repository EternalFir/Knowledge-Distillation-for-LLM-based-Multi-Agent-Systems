In the last step, you should focus on the item you created or found to submit it to the environment.

Here is the task description:\n\n            Your task is to use chemistry to create the substance 'soapy water'. A recipe and some of the ingredients might be found near the workshop. When you are done, focus on the soapy water.\n\n            When looking around, you can see\n            This room is called the bedroom.
