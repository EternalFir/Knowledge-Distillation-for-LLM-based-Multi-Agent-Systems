When you are done, focus on the blue paper.\n\n            When looking around, you can see\n            This room is called the workshop.

On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue wire, a orange wire, a red light bulb, which is off, a switch, which is off, a violet light bulb, which is off, a yellow light bulb, which is off.\n\ta ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed. \nYou also see:\n\tA door to the hallway (that is closed)\n\n\n            # Output\n            Each sub-task should be given in JSON format with the following structure\n\n            {\n                \"order\" : The order of the sub-task, must be a number,\n                \"sub-task\" : detailed description of the sub-task\n            }\n\n            # Notes\n\n            * Your output must be JSON only.\n\n            ```json\n            "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please give out your plan."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```json\n[\n    {\n        \"order\": 1,\n        \"sub-task\": \"Use the battery and wires (e.g., black and blue) to create a circuit connecting the switch and the violet light bulb.
