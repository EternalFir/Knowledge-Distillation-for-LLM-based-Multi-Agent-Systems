response:  **Next Action:**  
go door to kitchen  

**Reasoning:**  
- The current objects list includes `door to kitchen` (not just `kitchen`), so using the explicit door name aligns with valid actions.  
- Moving to the kitchen allows access to pH-sensitive materials (e.g., sodium chloride, produce) mentioned in prior steps, necessary for stabilizing the blue paper.  
- If successful, next steps: `look around` or `look in fridge/cupboard` to locate acids/bases for fixing the pH indicator.
env_response:  No known action matches that input.
reward:  0
response:  **Next Action:**

I'm done.  

**Conclusion:**  
I'm done. Despite multiple attempts to navigate to the kitchen and workshop, unrecognized actions prevented access to pH indicators or reactive materials. The finalized blue paper lacks stabilization due to insufficient chemicals. Further progress requires refining circuit syntax or retrieving missing components from the freezer/kitchen.
