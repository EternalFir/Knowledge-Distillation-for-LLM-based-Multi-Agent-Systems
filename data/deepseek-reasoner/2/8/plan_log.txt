In the last step, you should focus on the item you created or found to submit it to the environment. Remember, you should focus on the item you want itself, not its container or its location or something else.\n            # Task\n            The task is chemistry-mix. Here is the task description:\n\n            Your task is to use chemistry to create the substance 'salt water'. A recipe and some of the ingredients might be found near the workshop. When you are done, focus on the salt water.\n\n            When looking around, you can see\n            This room is called the bathroom. In it, you see: \n\tthe agent\n\ta substance called air\n\ta bathtub, which is turned off. In the bathtub is: nothing.\n\ta glass cup (containing nothing)\n\ta picture\n\ta sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.\n\ta toilet. In the toilet is: A drain, which is open, a substance called water.\nYou also see:\n\tA door to the kitchen (that is closed)\n\n\n            # Output\n            Each sub-task should be given in JSON format with the following structure\n\n            {\n                \"order\" : The order of the sub-task, must be a number,\n                \"sub-task\" : detailed description of the sub-task\n            }\n\n            # Notes\n\n            * Your output must be JSON only.\n\n            ```json\n            "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please give out your plan."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```json\n[\n    {\n        \"order\": 1,\n        \"sub-task\": \"Open the closed door to the kitchen to access potential ingredients.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"order\": 2,\n        \"sub-task\": \"Go to the kitchen to search for the 'salt' ingredient required for the mixture.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"order\": 3,\n        \"sub-task\": \"Retrieve salt from the kitchen and bring it back to the bathroom.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"order\": 4,\n        \"sub-task\": \"Collect water from the toilet using the empty glass cup as a container.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"order\": 5,\n        \"sub-task\": \"Add the retrieved salt into the glass cup containing water.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"order\": 6,\n        \"sub-task\": \"Stir the mixture in the glass cup to fully dissolve the salt, forming salt water.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"order\": 7,\n        \"sub-task\": \"Focus directly on the resulting salt water (substance) in the glass cup to finalize the task.\"\n    }\n]\n```"}]
