evaluation: ["No","The plan assumes a cold surface (picture's glass) exists and that exhaling is possible, but neither is confirmed in observations/actions. Suggest checking room accessibility (open doors) for resources like kitchen (freezer) or workshop (tools). Use available actions like 'use OBJ' to create condensation if possible."]
evaluation: ["No","Revised plan improves by checking doors, but 'use door' isn't a valid action (should be 'open'). Also, 'use picture' action doesn't exist (try 'focus on picture'). Missing collection step (use 'pick up' if droplets form). Verify action syntax matches available actions list."]
evaluation: ["No","Plan correctly uses 'open' action but still assumes exhaling (not a valid action). Replace 'exhale' with available actions (e.g., 'use air on picture' invalid; perhaps 'activate picture' if it's a cooling device). Also, ensure 'water droplets' exist before 'pick up' (may need 'look at picture' to confirm condensation first)."]
evaluation: ["No","Assumes freezer/blowtorch exist (not observed). Replace 'focus on freezer/blowtorch' with 'look in kitchen/workshop' first. 'Focus on air' isn't actionable - use 'activate picture' (if coolable) or 'wait' for condensation. Verify droplets exist via 'look at picture' before pickup."]
evaluation: ["Yes","Good job! The plan now properly uses 'look in' to verify resources and valid actions like 'activate' and 'wait'. It maintains contingency paths and checks droplet visibility before collection. No syntax/action violations. Assumptions (freezer/tools) are now conditional on exploration."]
