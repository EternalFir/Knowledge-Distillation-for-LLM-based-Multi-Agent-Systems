evaluation: ["No","The sub-tasks assume unavailable actions (exhale breath) and objects (collection tools). Suggest using available actions like 'focus on air' to locate vapor, 'use cold surface' (none present) or check other rooms via 'go' to find better state-change methods like freezing/heating."]
evaluation: ["Yes","Good job! The revised plan uses available actions (open/go/use), leverages probable kitchen resources, and addresses state changes through feasible temperature methods. Ensures access to required substances/appliances via room transitions."]
