evaluation: ["No", "The plan assumes ice exists in the cupboard, but current observations don't confirm this. Add a step to check cupboard contents first, and handle cases where ice/water isn't found. Consider alternative methods like using paint water if applicable."]
evaluation: ["Yes", "Improved plan addresses prior assumptions by verifying cupboard contents and providing alternative paths. However, consider adding a step to confirm paint is water-based using 'look at OBJ' before using it as substitute."]
