evaluation: ["No","The large cupboard's contents are unknown; assuming water is present is risky. Check inventory or environment for water sources first, or consider using available paints if allowed. Otherwise, search elsewhere for water."]
evaluation: ["No","While checking paints for water content is creative, extracting water from paint (even water-based) isn't practical. Pouring paint into bowl would mix colors, not isolate water. Confirming gaseous state via 'focus' lacks actionable method. Prioritize finding pure water sources first before complex extraction attempts."]
evaluation: ["No","Assumes existence of unconfirmed resources (sink, heater, freezer, window sunlight). Without verifying these in environment observations, steps 4-5 may be impossible. Check available heat/cold sources first using 'look around' or 'inspect hallway' actions before planning state-change methods."]
evaluation: ["Yes","Good job! Steps now properly verify resource availability before acting and use observable confirmation for state changes without unwarranted assumptions. Maintains logical progression through environment exploration."]
