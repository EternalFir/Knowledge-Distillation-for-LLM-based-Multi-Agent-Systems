evaluation: ["No", "The cupboard's contents are not visible and may not contain ice. Check if ice is present first or find another water source (e.g., use paint cups if they contain water). If not, consider alternative methods like using available items to create water or explore other rooms."]
evaluation: ["No", "Assuming paints are water-based is risky without verification. Use 'look at OBJ' to check paint composition first. If not water-based, alternatives like collecting atmospheric moisture or exploring other rooms (e.g., hallway) for water sources are needed. Also, evaporation of paint may leave residue, not pure water vapor."]
evaluation: ["Yes","Good job! The plan now properly verifies paint composition and explores alternatives. However, check if hallway access is possible and if environmental conditions (temperature) allow evaporation/freezing. If not, suggest using tools (activate heater/cooler) to facilitate state change."]
