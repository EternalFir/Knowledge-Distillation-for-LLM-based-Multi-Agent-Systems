evaluation: ["No", "The sub-tasks assume ingredients (oil, lye, water) are in the cupboard without verification. First check cupboard contents explicitly. If unavailable, suggest alternative paths (e.g., check paints for emulsifiers, explore hallway for water). Saponification requires time/heatâ€”simplify by prioritizing pre-made soap. Add contingency steps if resources are missing."]
evaluation: ["Yes","Good job! The revised plan properly verifies cupboard contents first, adds paint examination for alternatives, addresses water sourcing (hallway/containers), simplifies saponification, and includes failure recovery. Contingencies align with observed environment (paints, closed door)."]
