**Note:** After several attempts, it's clear that the glass jar only contains salt (sodium chloride) and lacks water. To resolve this, the correct sequence would be:  
1. **Dunk cup in sink** (to fill the cup with water).  
2. **Pour cup in glass jar** (add water to the salt).  
3. **Mix glass jar** (now containing both salt and water).  

Since the task requires only one action per response, the immediate next step would be to **dunk cup in sink** to fetch water.  

However, since the assistant is constrained to reply with one action per step, the final answer below strictly follows the instruction.
